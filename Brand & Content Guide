The Ledger: Brand & Content Guide

1. Core Identity

Brand Name
The Ledger

Tagline
Just the facts. Not the spin.

Mission Statement
In an era of intense political tribalism, the UK's public discourse is dominated by spin and ideology. We believe that citizens deserve access to clear, objective, and data-driven analysis to make their own informed decisions. The Ledger exists to cut through the noise by providing the unfiltered data and non-partisan analysis that is often missing from the headlines. We don't tell you what to think; we give you the tools to think for yourself.

2. Content Strategy: The Core Pillars
The site's content is built on distinct, clearly separated pillars. This separation is fundamental to our credibility and is managed through a data-driven Eleventy architecture.

Pillar 1: "The Ledger" (Article Type: Entry)
Purpose: To present objective, verifiable facts and data. This is the foundation of the brand.
Content-Type: Data-driven articles, infographics, statistical breakdowns, and detailed reports. These are generated from data files (e.g., ledger.11tydata.js).
Core Rule: Zero personal opinion or speculative commentary. The content must be clinical, neutral, and focused solely on presenting the evidence.
Goal: To be an unimpeachable source of truth that allows the reader to form their own conclusions based on the data provided.

Pillar 2: "The Commentary" (Article Type: Op-Ed)
Purpose: To explore the implications of the data presented in The Ledger. This is the "so what?" section.
Content-Type: Opinion pieces, op-eds, and analytical essays that provide context, explore potential solutions, and discuss political narratives. These are also generated from data files (e.g., commentary.11tydata.js).
Core Rule: Must be clearly distinguished from Ledger Entries. While it can be passionate and subjective, all arguments must be rooted in evidence and reason, often referencing data from The Ledger itself.
Goal: To provide a thoughtful, informed perspective that adds depth and context to the data, without compromising the objectivity of the core "Ledger" entries.

3. Visual Identity
The visual style is designed to be serious, analytical, and non-partisan. It avoids the primary colours associated with UK political parties and instead adopts a "dossier" or "analyst's terminal" aesthetic.

Colour Palette:
Primary Background: Charcoal Grey / Dark Blue (#111827)
Primary Text: Off-White / Light Grey (#d1d5db)
Accent Colour: Sharp Amber/Yellow (#facc15) for buttons, links, and key highlights.
Supporting Greys: A range of greys for cards, borders, and secondary text.

Typography:
Headings (h1, h2, h3): Roboto to convey authority and seriousness.
Body Text (p, li): Source Sans Pro for clarity and modern appeal.

4. Tone of Voice
The language used across the site must be consistent with the brand's mission.

Analytical & Precise: Use clear, unambiguous language. Define terms where necessary.
Objective & Neutral (Especially in Ledger Entries): Avoid loaded words, emotional appeals, and hyperbole.
Direct & Economical: Get straight to the point. Avoid jargon and unnecessary fluff.
Inquisitive: Frame analysis as an investigation. Use questions to guide the reader through the data.
Skeptical: Maintain a healthy, non-cynical skepticism of all official narratives and talking points, regardless of their political source.

5. Guiding Principles for Content Decisions
Does this serve the reader's understanding? Every piece of content should aim to clarify, not confuse.
Is the line between data and opinion clear? A reader must always know whether they are reading an objective "Entry" or a subjective "Commentary."
Is the source credible? All data must be sourced from reputable, verifiable origins (e.g., ONS, OBR, NAO, IFS).
Does this challenge tribalism? The content should encourage critical thinking, not reinforce pre-existing biases.

6. Subreddit Pages: Community Insights
Purpose: These pages provide dynamic, data-driven insights into specific subreddits, analyzing sentiment, common topics, and key discussions related to UK politics.
Functionality: These pages are generated from subreddits.11tydata.js and individual subreddit HTML files (e.g., LabourUK.html).
Content Focus: While they reflect community sentiment, the presentation of data should remain neutral and analytical, aligning with The Ledger's core principles.
Visuals: They use subreddit-specific logos and consistent branding.

7. Archive Page: Historical Content Access
Purpose: The archive page's role is a central repository for all published articles, allowing users to easily browse and access past content.
Functionality: It provides a chronological or categorized listing of both "Ledger" and "Commentary" articles.
Navigation: It is important for discoverability and long-term content accessibility.
