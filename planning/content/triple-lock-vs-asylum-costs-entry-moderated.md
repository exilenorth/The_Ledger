# A Comparative Fiscal Analysis: The Financial Implications of UK Asylum Policy versus the State Pension Triple Lock

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comparative fiscal analysis of two prominent and costly areas of UK public policy: the management of asylum and irregular migration, with a focus on small boat crossings, and the state pension triple lock. The objective is to determine which policy area, if fundamentally altered, would yield greater financial savings for the UK government. The analysis moves beyond headline figures to assess the nature, certainty, and long-term trajectory of the costs and potential savings associated with each.

The findings indicate that while the costs of managing the asylum system are acute and volatile, the fiscal burden of the state pension triple lock is substantially larger, more certain, and structurally embedded in the UK's public finances.

The total cost of the UK asylum system reached £5.4 billion in the 2023/24 financial year, driven primarily by hotel accommodation for asylum seekers. A hypothetical cessation of small boat arrivals could yield annual savings estimated between £3 billion and £5 billion. However, these savings are uncertain and contingent on the success of costly ongoing enforcement measures.

In contrast, the state pension triple lock—a mechanism that uprates pensions by the highest of inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%—imposes a direct and recurring additional cost. Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) quantifies this additional annual cost at approximately £11 billion compared to a simpler indexation method. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects this figure will rise to £15.5 billion annually by 2029-30.

Therefore, abolishing the triple lock offers immediate, structural, and compounding savings that are at least double the plausible savings from stopping all small boat crossings. The savings from pension reform are a matter of arithmetic and would alter the UK's long-term fiscal trajectory. The savings from halting small boat crossings, while significant, address an operational overspend and remain hypothetical. This report concludes that from a purely fiscal perspective, addressing the state pension triple lock represents a greater opportunity for sustainable, long-term savings.

## Section 1: The Fiscal Landscape of UK Asylum and Irregular Migration

The financial commitment required to manage the UK's asylum system has escalated in recent years. This section provides a breakdown of these expenditures, analyses the fiscal impact of key policy interventions, and assesses the uncertainty surrounding future costs.

### 1.1 Deconstructing the Costs: A Forensic Breakdown of Expenditure

In the financial year 2023/24, the cost of operating the system rose to £5.4 billion. This expenditure is managed by the Home Office's Asylum Support, Resettlement, and Accommodation (ASRA) group.

**Accommodation Costs:** The single largest driver of expenditure is asylum accommodation. A May 2025 report by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that the projected cost of the government's ten-year Asylum Accommodation and Support Contracts (AASCs) has surged from an initial estimate of £4.5 billion to £15.3 billion. In the 2023-24 financial year, the Home Office spent an estimated £3.1 billion on hotels, which housed only 35% of the people in the asylum accommodation system but accounted for 76% of the total accommodation contract costs.

**Direct Support Costs:** Destitute asylum seekers are entitled to financial support of £49.18 per person per week for those in self-catered accommodation. A 2023 report by Policy Exchange estimated the annual cost of these allowances, specifically related to small boats, was £187 million.

**Enforcement and Border Security Costs:** This includes the annual budget for Border Force (£1.2 billion) and payments to France (€541 million between 2023/24 and 2025/26) to enhance patrols.

**Administrative and Wider System Costs:** The Policy Exchange report estimated annual healthcare costs associated with the small boats crisis at £335 million and state-school provision at £90 million.

### 1.2 Policy Interventions and Their Fiscal Footprint

Successive governments have implemented policies aimed at deterring small boat crossings. A returns agreement with France was established, allowing the UK to return some asylum seekers. The now-abandoned Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda had a minimum cost of £370 million, with the policy projected to cost £169,000 per person deported. Scrapping the Rwanda scheme is forecast to save £800 million in 2024–25.

### 1.3 Projecting the Unpredictable: Future Costs and Volatility

Projecting future costs is difficult due to the unpredictable number of arrivals. The Home Office has consistently spent more than planned on asylum operations. For the 2024–25 financial year, the Treasury identified an estimated £6.4 billion in spending pressures related to asylum and illegal migration. The Home Office projected that without action, asylum support costs could rise to £11 billion a year by the end of 2026.

### 1.4 Quantifying Potential Savings from "Stopping the Boats"

A hypothetical cessation of small boat crossings would eliminate direct support costs. A central estimate would place this potential annual saving in the range of £3 billion to £5 billion. However, savings on enforcement are not guaranteed and would likely require sustained expenditure.

## Section 2: The State Pension Triple Lock: A Compounding Fiscal Commitment

The financial burden of the state pension triple lock is a structural feature of UK public finances.

### 2.1 Mechanics and the "Ratchet Effect"

The triple lock uprates the state pension annually by the highest of three metrics: CPI inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. This creates a "ratchet effect," systematically pushing the pension's value upwards over time.

### 2.2 Quantifying the Additional Cost of the Triple Lock

The total pensioner benefits bill in Great Britain was forecast to be £138 billion in 2023-24. According to the IFS, the triple lock costs an additional £11 billion per year compared to a scenario where the pension was uprated by either earnings or inflation. The OBR forecasts this will rise to £15.5 billion by 2029-30.

| Uprating Policy | Estimated Additional Annual Cost (Current) | Projected Additional Annual Cost (c. 2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Triple Lock (vs. Earnings Link) | £11 billion | £15.5 billion |
| Double Lock (vs. Earnings Link) | Lower, but undoes only ~25% of the triple lock's long-term cost | - |
| Smoothed Earnings Link | £0 (by definition) | £0 (by definition) |

### 2.3 The Long-Term Trajectory: A Structural Fiscal Pressure

The triple lock is a primary driver of future increases in age-related spending. State pension spending is forecast to rise from 4.6% of GDP in 2023/24 to 5.1% by 2025/26. The triple lock mechanism itself is responsible for 1.6 percentage points of the projected 2.7 percentage point GDP increase in pension spending over the next 50 years.

### 2.4 Quantifying Potential Savings from Abolishing the Triple Lock

Abolishing the triple lock would generate immediate savings of £10 billion to £11 billion per annum. Replacing it with a "double lock" would save less than £5 billion a year in 50 years' time. The most fiscally significant savings would come from moving to a link to average earnings.

## Section 3: A Comparative Fiscal Reckoning

This section brings the findings into direct comparison.

### 3.1 Annual Savings: A Direct Comparison

*   **Stopping Small Boat Crossings:** £3 billion to £5 billion annual saving (Low certainty).
*   **Abolishing the Triple Lock:** £10 billion to £11 billion annual saving (High certainty).

Abolishing the triple lock offers, at a minimum, double the immediate annual savings.

| Policy Change | Estimated Annual Saving (Central Estimate) | Fiscal Certainty | Nature of Saving |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stopping Small Boat Crossings | £3 billion – £5 billion | Low | Volatile, Operational, Contingent |
| Abolishing Pensions Triple Lock | £10 billion – £11 billion | High | Structural, Compounding, Certain |

### 3.2 Long-Term Fiscal Impact and Sustainability

Savings from managing immigration are contingent and non-compounding. Savings from pension reform are structural and compounding, permanently lowering the baseline of government spending.

### 3.3 An Assessment of Fiscal Certainty

The certainty of savings from immigration policy is low. The certainty of savings from pension reform is high, being a matter of arithmetic.

## Section 4: Beyond the Balance Sheet: Wider Economic and Social Implications

Both policy choices carry economic and social consequences.

### 4.1 Intergenerational Equity and the Social Contract

**Pensions:** The triple lock was introduced to reverse a decline in the state pension's value. Supporters argue it ensures income adequacy. Critics contend it creates intergenerational unfairness.

**Immigration:** High levels of migration can place pressure on public services. Conversely, immigration brings economic and social benefits, with migrants contributing to the economy.

### 4.2 The Nature of the Challenge: Operational Crisis vs. Structural Strain

**Small Boat Crossings:** An acute operational crisis driven by external factors.
**The Triple Lock:** A chronic structural strain on public finances, driven by an internal formula.

## Section 5: Conclusion

The evidence leads to a clear conclusion: Abolishing the pensions triple lock would save the UK government significantly more money than stopping small boat crossings. The potential savings are larger, more certain, and would permanently lower the baseline of government spending.
