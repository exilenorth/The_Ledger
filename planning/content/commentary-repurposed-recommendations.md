### On Pensions:

*   **Reform the Uprating Mechanism:** The government should move to replace the triple lock with a more predictable and fiscally sustainable uprating mechanism. An explicit link to average earnings, potentially smoothed over a number of years or with a safeguard to protect against short-term price shocks, would remove the "ratchet effect" and the associated uncertainty and long-term cost pressures.
*   **Set a Formal Target:** To provide clarity and stability for individuals planning for retirement and for the public finances, the government should formally set a target for the level of the new state pension as a percentage of average earnings. This would anchor the system and allow for a more transparent and planned approach to achieving pension adequacy without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability.
*   **Implement a Public Communication Strategy:** Any reform to the triple lock will be politically sensitive. It must be accompanied by a clear and honest public communication campaign explaining the necessity of the change for long-term sustainability, the protection of public services, and the promotion of intergenerational fairness.

### On Asylum:

*   **Tackle Operational Inefficiencies:** The most urgent priority is to address the gross inefficiencies that drive a large portion of the cost. The government must develop and implement a long-term strategy to move away from the use of expensive contingency hotels and towards a more cost-effective model of dispersed accommodation, working in close partnership with local authorities. This requires a fundamental overhaul of procurement and contract management.
*   **Invest in Processing Capacity:** Reducing the time it takes to process asylum claims is critical. Longer waiting times directly translate into higher cumulative costs for accommodation and support. Investing in additional, efficient caseworkers to clear the backlog and speed up decision-making for new claims will yield direct fiscal returns.
